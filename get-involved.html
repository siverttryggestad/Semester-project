        <h2>Support the museum</h2>
        <p>
          There are several ways you can support the museum. Donations are always
          welcome and are an important way we keep the museum open and accessible
          to the whole community.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s
          collections. If you have an item or collection that you think others
          would enjoy, please contact our Collections Department and they will
          be able to assist you.

        <h2>Volunteer</h2>
        <p>
          A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays
          in good order and ready for visitors to enjoy. Volunteering has its
          perks, including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Volunteers also get access to staff-only lectures and a monthly lunch
          where staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future
          exhibits and museum strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can help in a number of different areas around the museum. Please
          contact us if you would like to find out more about how you can get
          involved as a volunteer.

        <h2>Internships</h2>
        <p>
          Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and
          excitement of sharing the wonders of science with people?
        </p>
        <p>
          An internship at the museum is a chance to learn from academics and
          people who are passionate about science and science communication. You
          will gain valuable experience in how a modern, community-focused museum
          works.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this sounds like you, please get in touch to learn more about
          current internship opportunities at the museum.
